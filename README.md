- Two applications that allow clients of the company to perform incoming and outgoing financial transactions respectively.
- A server used by employees of the enterprise which hosts an application to track client's payments and perform currency exchange operations over the payments.
- Several personal computers used by the employees to carry out their duties.
- An SQL Server to store the data related to the financial transactions.
## Repository Description
